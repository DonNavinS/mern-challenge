# mern-challenge
# Book Search Engine Starter Code
For this challenge we had to modify an existing application to make it use technologies associated with the MERN stack. This involved creating queries, mutations, and 
different type models using GraphQL, which would be used to interact with a MongoDB database to execute what are essentially CRUD operations. The queries and mutations
would then be dsiplayed on a React front-end. 

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete some of the required tasks for this assignment. I was short on time and did not have a chance to properly work through many
of the issues I faced when trying to implement the MERN stack into the application. For example, while I was able to set up the GraphQL queries and mutations as well 
as the User and Book types, I wasn't able to properly implement them using the useMutation React Hook. I also tried implementing pages for Login and Signup 
functionality but could not get it to work properly. The main issues I seemed to face were connecting the front end to the back end and keeping track of all the 
different files and their purposes and how they were connected to other files. At many points I felt confused as to what I should even do next because it seemed so 
overwhelming.

Going forward I plan on trying to familiarize myself more with how to use multiple technologies and have them interacting with each other. I feel fairly comfortable
with each component of the MERN stack on it's own, but putting everything together will be my next big goal that I would like to achieve.
